Download the git repo as a ZIP file
create a new folder 
extract zip into that folder

Then open your XAMPP server 
Start Apache and MySQL
go to mySql admin 
create a database called eventmanagement
open the database folder in the Event-Managemet system and import eventmanagement.sql file into that created database 
save and keep

now open your downloaded and saved folder in Intellij IDEA (recommended) / (Event-Managemet system - this folder)
go to -> src -> main -> java -> EventmanagementApplication ( this is the main file )
then run EventmanagementApplication this will connect the tomcat server (backend)

now in the saved folder there is another folder called eventfrontend (Event_management -> eventfrontend)
open this in VScode
then open a new terminal and run (npm install) command
after installed run (npm start) command

Now you can run the application in the browser
